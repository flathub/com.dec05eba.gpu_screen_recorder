# GPU Screen Recorder
This is a screen recorder that has minimal impact on system performance by recording a window using the GPU only, similar to shadowplay on windows. This is the fastest screen recording tool for Linux. It's currently limited to nvidia GPUs and X11 (wayland with xwayland does NOT work).
