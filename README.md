# GPU Screen Recorder
This is a screen recorder that has minimal impact on system performance by recording a monitor using the GPU only, similar to shadowplay on windows. This is the fastest screen recording tool for Linux. This software works on X11 and Wayland.

The source code is available at https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder/ and the source code for the gui is available at https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder-gtk/

Do not report issues here unless it's an issue with the flatpak specifically. GPU Screen Recorder issues should be reported here: https://github.com/dec05eba/gpu-screen-recorder-issues/issues

I do not accept feature requests!
